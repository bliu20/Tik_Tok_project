For this project, the goal is to develop a model that can determine if a video is a claim or an opinion using a fictional dataset. Models such as random forest and XGBoost were considered as candidates of the project's final model. Before developing the model, EDA was performed to determined factors that can distinguish a video as claim or opinion. 

The project is broken down into 5 files in order to show progress - starting from cleaning data to modeling the data.
